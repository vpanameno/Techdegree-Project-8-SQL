# Techdegree-Project-8-SQL: SQL Library Manager

In this project, I created a library application using Express and SQLite database using Sequelize CLI. I revisited using Pug, and error handling to provide a better way to display errors when there isn't a book available with that ID and pages that don't exist. I have created an app that eases the way the user enters data into the library database using buttons, commands and visuals (adding to the book list).
